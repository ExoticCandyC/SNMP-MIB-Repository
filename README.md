# SNMP MIB Repository

All the MIB files provided in this directory are ASN.1 compliant and can be loaded by any standard MIB browser.

# MIB monitoring suggestions

My suggestion is the ireasoning MIB browser, as it is fast, lightweight and supports the SMI syntax used in the MIB files. It is multi-platform and supports Linux, Mac-OS and Windows.

For Android devices, my suggestion is "SNMP Manager" by "Gao Feng"
